            <h3>Introduction</h3>
    
            <p>In North America, the most common game fish targeted is the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largemouth_bass" target="_blank"> Black Bass</a> (colloquially known
                as the largemouth
                bass). The fish are found in almost every body of fresh water, so it's no wonder why anglers across the country
                eagerly target these fish. These fish are incredibly agressive, and are eager to eat almost anything that
                can fit in their mouth. These fish are know to eat frogs, mice, bluegill and even smaller members of their own species! 
                Unlike their close relative smallmouth bass, largemouths prefer warm and still water. They will spend most of their day 
                sitting underneath cover such as an overhanging tree. This makes it relatively easy to locate a group of bass in any body of water,
                as they will typically gravitate to the same enviroments. Its a smart idea to start each fishing trip with pitching a slow moving bait underneath obvious cover 
                as you are more than likely to get a bite.

        <h3>Fishing Lures</h3>
        <p2>
            Lures designed to target largemouth vary tremendously in their design. They may imitate a struggling
            baitfish slowly swimming along, or replicate a frog quickly hopping from lilypad to lilypad. In order to correctly determine
            which lure to use, you must keep in mind a few things.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>Time of day:</i>
            largemouth are most active at dawn and dusk, as these are prime feeding times.
                In this window throwing almost any lure is sure to get some bites, but pay attention to the fauna you see at these times. 
                Typically you will observe bluegill moving off their beds, so using a paddletale is reccomended. If you are fishing closer to midday,
                the bite will be much slower. It is reccomend to throw a slow moving lure, such as a stick bait in order to intice sluggish fish.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>Weather:</i>
            As much as we love warm and sunny days, fish do not. As the water gets above 73 degrees, fish become increasingly more lethargic. They prefer cooler, cloudier days. In these 
            prime conditions, consider throwing a top-water lure such as a frog. If the fish are active, you will see them jump out of the water to grab your lure!
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>Season:</i>
            Largrmouth follow a tight schedule, and are thus very predictable. In the Winter, they will be at the deepest parts of their body of water, entering something similar to hibernation. In the Spring, spawn begins
            which is arguably the best time to fish. Male bass will begin to create beds in order to raise their young, so throwing a lure which imitates a hungry bluegill trying to steal eggs is sure to be effective. For this, a ned-rig is reccomended. During the Summer and Fall,
            the bass will slow down again and disperse throughout the water. A crankbait is useful for locating these isolated fish.
